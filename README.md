# Filter Operation
Digital Signal Processing project on filter design.

## Description
This is a project about FILTER design. A certain input signal, which was corrupt with some noise, was given and I was to use an FIR Filter to denoise the signal. 

## Result
The signal was denoised and output was a clean sinusoidal wave of the input signal.
